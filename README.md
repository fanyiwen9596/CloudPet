# CloudPet
In modern society, pets are becoming an increasingly indispensable part of human’s life. However, not every pet lovers are able to continually take care of their own pets due to the limitation of location change, allergy, economics and patience. As a result, these pets have possibilities of becoming stray pets. Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year and approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized.
Our motivation for this project is helping pet animals from being stray, threw into shelters and even euthanized. We put our project’s entry point at cutting down the number of owners who have potential pet abandonment through providing them a new method of pet adoption, called Cloud Pet Adoption, in our mobile application.
