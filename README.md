# CloudPet
People love pets but they are not able to continuously take care of their pets due to limited time, changes in life, high cost of ownership, and pets stray. 
Based on our research, each year approximately 6.5 million pets ended up in the local shelters and among those animals 20% were finally euthanized.
Our motivation for this project is helping pet animals from being stray, threw into shelters and even euthanized, and therefore, we are developing a simple iOS mobile application to help with reducing the number of discarded pets. 

We would like put our project’s entry point at dealing with several small sub-problem under the huge topic of discarded pets. 
	
1) helping pet lovers to build up a correct and accurate understanding of their responsibilities and offering those who not currently own one a platform to virtually interact with their “cloudpetted” pets;
2) helping to solve the problem of high cost of ownership.
3) helping to pair the owners who are going to move or leave for a while with other users who can take care of the pets, 
4) helping to deal with lost or strayed pets problem.
